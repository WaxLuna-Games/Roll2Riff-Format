Episode Types
=============

1.  How To Play - Episodes that give tutorials on a game, or a part of a game.
2.  Discussion of Topic - The bulk of episodes will be this.  A co-host or two, perhaps a special guest will join, but we will take a topic in gaming and have a safe and fun discussion about the topic.
3.  Reviews - Do we like the game?  Perhaps we don't.
4.  Interviews - I'll take a co-host and interview someone in the gaming world.  Perhaps a designer, an actual play player, whoever we think of to talk to.
5.  News - News in the gaming world?  It happens beyond the new releases.
